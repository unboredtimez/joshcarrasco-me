  <h3>About Josh</h3>
  <div>
    <p>I've had a passion for technology for as long as I can remember. As I child I remember taking apart my family computer and putting it back together because of my curiosity for how it worked. That same curiosity still follows me as I now dissect software logs and code to identify issues and build solutions.</p>
    <p>I strongly believe in working as a team to achieve greatness. With that being said I also enjoy team based activities like escape rooms and certain board games.</p>
