        <h2>About Josh</h2>
        <div>
          <p>I've had a passion for technology for as long as I can remember. As I child I remember taking apart my family computer and putting it back together because of my curiosity for how it worked. That same curiosity still follows me as I now dissect software logs and code to identify issues and build solutions.</p>
          <p>I strongly believe in working as a team to achieve greatness. With that being said I also enjoy team based activities like escape rooms and board games. Playing video games is a great way for me to relax and wind down after a hard day of work.</p>
